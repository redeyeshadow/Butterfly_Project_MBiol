# Butterfly_Project_MBiol
This repository contains my code, data and figures for my project on using museum collections to investigate how Lepidopteran morphology has changed over time in relation to global change. In 'data' I have provided all the data I collected, in 'src' I have put my code that I used to produce statistical results and graphs, in 'out' I have provided my figures and results tables.
