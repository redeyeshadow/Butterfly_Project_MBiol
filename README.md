# Butterfly_Project_MBiol


This repository contains code, data and figures to support Heywood et al. *Museum specimens reveal butterfly size increases through time but divergent responses to temperature*



for my project on using museum collections to investigate how L
epidopteran morphology has changed over time in relation to global change. 

Structure:

`src/` Contains R scripts (.rmd markdown format) to reproduce all results and figures. Scripts are numbered for the order they would need to be run. 
- Cleaning1
- Cleaning2
- Cleaning3
- Cleaning4
- Cleaning5
- StatsFitting1
- StatsFitting2
- StatsFitting3
- StatsFitting4
- SuppInfo1
- SuppInfo2


`SI.tex` complines the pdf for the SI files. 


`data/` Contains raw and semi-processed data

Navigating these files would be easiest from the respective R scripts described above. 

`figs/` Output figures. 
`statsresults/ ` .csv files of the posterior summaries
`NHM_modelfits`
